Page Specific Stylesheets
=========================

Page Specific Stylesheets is a simple plugin that allows you to add styles to a page, post, or custom post type from the edit screen on the admin panel. This provides you with an easy method of maintaining styles specific to that post while keeping your style.css free from clutter that doesn't need loaded on every page.

This is now the official repository for development of the plugin, however, it the plugin is still maintained on the WordPress Plugin Directory.
